They are autonomous and there is no chance that you would forget to do them.
If you listed the things you do each day that are recurring tasks but aren&amp;rsquo;t autonomous, you would be surprised how many things you have to remember.

Because the carriers could price different modes of communication, be it voice, data, SMS, differently it means they could adjust their profits over time as usage of these different channels shifted so they could stay ahead of any curve.
The argument for a data-only provider is that all communication can be transmitted over data and we can have one single method of communicating on a mobile phone and thereby turning providers into dumb pipes like a cable internet connection.</description></item></channel></rss>
